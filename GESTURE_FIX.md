# 🔧 **Gesture Error Fix - Instagram Reels Watch App**

## ❌ **Error Description**
The Xcode build was failing with the following error in `ReelPlayerView.swift`:

```
Value of type 'CGSize' has no member 'y'
Value of type 'CGSize' has no member 'x'
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause**
In the `DragGesture` code, I was incorrectly trying to access `.y` and `.x` properties from `value.translation`, but `CGSize` only has `.width` and `.height` properties.

**Incorrect Code:**
```swift
let verticalAmount = value.translation.y    // ❌ CGSize has no 'y' property
let horizontalAmount = value.translation.x  // ❌ CGSize has no 'x' property
```

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

**Fixed Code:**
```swift
let verticalAmount = value.translation.height    // ✅ CGSize has 'height' property
let horizontalAmount = value.translation.width   // ✅ CGSize has 'width' property
```

## 🎯 **Result**
- ✅ **Compilation successful** - All Swift files now compile without errors
- ✅ **Gesture detection working** - Swipe detection feedback is functional
- ✅ **Backward compatible** - All other functionality remains intact
- ✅ **Enhanced scrolling** - Visual feedback for swipe gestures

## 🚀 **Gesture Features Now Working**

### **Swipe Navigation:**
- **Swipe UP** → Go to next reel
- **Swipe DOWN** → Go to previous reel
- **Visual feedback** → Console logs show swipe direction

### **Per-Reel Controls:**
- **Tap anywhere** → Toggle mute/unmute
- **Long press (0.5s)** → Pause/resume playback
- **Swipe detection** → Enhanced feedback for navigation

## 🧪 **Verification**
Run the test script to confirm everything is working:
```bash
./test_instagram_reels.sh
```

**All tests pass!** ✅
